The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between Stanford Online and DeepLearning.AI. 
This beginner-friendly program will teach you the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications.

This 3-course Specialization is an updated and expanded version of Andrew Ngâ€™s pioneering Machine Learning course. It provides a broad introduction to 
modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), 
unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used for artificial intelligence 
and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)
